/*In this example, the benders variable is declared as an array of BendingArts objects, and it is assigned two instances of FireBender and WaterBender. 
The for...of loop iterates through the array, and it treats each object as an instance of the BendingArts class. 
In the loop, it calls the bendingTechnique() method of each object, which is a method inherited from the BendingArts class. 
Then we are checking with the help of instanceof keyword, whether the current bender is of FireBender class or WaterBender class 
and calling the respective class specific method, showFireBending() and showBloodBending().

This example demonstrates polymorphism because it allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, 
in this case, the BendingArts class. Even though FireBender and WaterBender have different methods, they can both be treated as BendingArts 
objects because they have the same properties and methods as that class.
